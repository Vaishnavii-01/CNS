# Practical 9 (Nmap)
nmap -p 1-200 <ip_address> (Scan TCP ports 1 through 200 on target)
nmap -F <ip_address> (Scans a smaller list of commonly used ports)
nmap -p <ip_address> (Scan only TCP port 80)
nmap -sT <ip_address> (Uses the OS networking stack to complete TCP handshakes)
nmap -sU <ip_address> (Checks UDP ports : often slower)
nmap -A <ip_address> (Combines several features : noisy)
nmap -O <ip_address> (OS fingerprinting)
nmap  <ip_address>/24 (subnet scan)
